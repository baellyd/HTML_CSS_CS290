		<p>Here is some text that I will use to wrap around the OSU image.  
		I'm not really sure what to say, so I'm kind of doing this stream of
		consciousness where I'll just shout out whatever comes to mind.  I've been
		super excited to finally take this class, as I've been looking forward to
		honing my HTML skills for quite some time.  I'm also especially looking forward 
		to diving into PHP and Javascript down the road. And then, who knows?  Maybe some
		animation.  Also this is the first time I've been introduced to assisted technology
		for impaired reading and hearing, so I'm really hoping to explore that further.</p>
		
		<p>So now that the first paragraph is done, here's some non-copyrighted text to 
		add.  It's the third paragraph of Crime and Punishment: This was not because he was 
		cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an 
		overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so 
		completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded 
		meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but 
		the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given 
		up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. 
		Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be stopped on 
		the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering 
		demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, 
		to prevaricate, to lieâ€”no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like 
		a cat and slip out unseen. </p></div>
